<h1 align="center">GeoZoom</h1>

<p>Welcome to GeoZoom! The goal of this game is to correctly identify where the randomized given location is on a world map. Look at the map on the left and guess on the map on the right. Use as few zoom outs as possible and guess as accurately as you can for the most amount of points. Good luck!</p>

<p>GeoZoom updates every night at 12 AM EST. Play daily and try to beat your previous scores!</p>

<p>I made GeoZoom with the help of the GeoPandas library in Python, but the bulk of the site is coded in html.</p>

<p>Play at https://winstonprogramming.github.io/GeoZoomRemote/</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can run GeoZoom locally at https://github.com/winstonProgramming/GeoZoomLocal</p>
